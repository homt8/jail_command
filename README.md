#Jail Commands
----------
The idea hit me earlier tonight when building a small town on the DTAmedia server.. why isn't there a jail mod? With the help of homt (thank you again) this mod was born.

What does it do? It allows anyone with the "jail" priv to send players to jail and release them from jail. Every 30 seconds it sends prisoners back to jail (in case they escape). You can edit the init.lua file to change how often it sends the prisoners to jail and also the jail coordinates. and also when a jail mods can put 2 commando in security as you can see /jail, <playername> /release <playername>.

To send someone to jail, do:
/jail playername

To release someone from jail do:
/release playername

You MUST build a jail before you can send someone to jail! (this shouldn't have to be mentioned but mentioning it anyway).

No screenshots are offered since theres nothing really to screenshot.

Feel free to offer better textures and any ideas. Also report any issues.
